# Backend for Mail Config Project

## TODO

* Refactor code -> improve it (maybe DAO Pattern?)
* Improve Frontend (e.q links in overview page to directly configure)
* Install npm maven plugin and -> start project with one command
* Push new features -> maybe after last small changes create new branch
